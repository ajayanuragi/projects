# Game of Life
Game of Life (or just “Life”) is not really a game. There’s no winning or losing or destroying your opponent mentally and spiritually. Life is a “cellular automaton” - a system of cells that live on a grid, where they live, die and evolve according to the rules that govern their world.

## Rules
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square  _cells_, each of which is in one of two possible states,  _live_  or  _dead_  (or  _populated_  and  _unpopulated_, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight  neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by under population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
